This is a Keyfob jammer i called Pacman ,because the jamming sounds like pacman eating !
this is for the lora 433Mhz version it wil detect a signal and starts jamming it ! ( eats it like pacman )
here in EU whe use 433.9100Mhz as Keyfobs , so its set on 433.9100Mhz
i included the libary's i use for my Paxcounter TTGO, where i put on this sketch i made ,
