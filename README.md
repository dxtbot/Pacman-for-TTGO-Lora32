# TTGO
Some things i made for the TTGO's Lora device's 
because i was bored i bought some Alix.xx TTGO's
i try to find other usage for these nice cheap boards !

for the TTGO Paxcounter board i made a Active Keyfob Pacman ,
it wil wait till there is a signal and start jamming it ,
its setup for 433.9100 EU standard for keyfobs ,
( also depent on the module you own there are different models using different operating freq )
