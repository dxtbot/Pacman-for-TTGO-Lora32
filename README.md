for the TTGO Paxcounter board i made a Active Keyfob Pacman ,
it wil wait till there is a signal and start jamming it ,
its setup for 433.9100 EU standard for keyfobs ,
( also depent on the module you own. There are different models using different operating freq 433/868/915Mhz ) 
for this project i used the 433 Mhz version.
